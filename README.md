This project will be based on these articles listed below:
`https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/integrating-django-with-reactjs-using-django-rest-framework/`
`https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-to-do-application-using-django-and-react`

In order to start virtual enviroment, run `source ./dar/bin/activate` in project directory.
